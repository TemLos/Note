With large enough bias, enough electrons will be pulled to “inverted” the surface(p->n-type)
**How to calculate threshold voltage**
$$
V_{T0}=V_{FB}+\varphi_s+\frac{Q_d}{C_{ox}}+\frac{Q_{ox}}{C_{ox}}
$$
$$
V_T=V_{T0}+\gamma\cdot(\sqrt{\varphi_s+V_{SB}}-\sqrt{\varphi_s})
$$
To control threshold voltage, we have to insulate P and N substrate.
