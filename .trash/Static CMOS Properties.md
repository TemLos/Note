## Static CMOS Properties
- Full rail-to-rail swing $\Rightarrow$ High noise margin
- Low output impedance $\Rightarrow$ Be able to drive large fan-out
- High input impedance
- No (low) static power dissipation

**How to deign a fast gate**
Consider RC Factor, we can improve swing speed by decreasing resister or capacitance of transistor.
