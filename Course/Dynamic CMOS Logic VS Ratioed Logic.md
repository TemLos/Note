### Similarities
- Logic function only implemented by PDN
- Less transistors compared with static CMOS logic circuit.

### Difference
- Ratioed logic circuit use GND to make sure that the PMOS is always ON.
- Dynamic logic circuit use clk signal to drive $M_P$, which make two -phase operation _Precharge_ and _Evaluate_.
- It's possible for Dynamic logic circuit to _suspend_.
- Due to almost negligible short current, Dynamic logic circuit has lower power dissipation.
- Dynamic logic circuit is ratioless.
